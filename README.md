Just a little area I can drop my stuff into


### Some words  
You do it the way that you want it. I like big trees. Big buildings are just little buildings that had a shot of vitamins. Drop in some happy little shadows. That's about enough right there. Really work it into the bristles. Think about form and shape -- how do you want this thing to be? It's a fantastic day here, and I hope it is wherever you're at. Let your imagination be your guide. Let some little things just shine through. Another thing that seems to give us a lot of problems is almighty clouds. Now we're ready to start working it. Angles are very, very important. All these fantastic things... they just sorta happen. Don't let this get too strong or it'll stand out.

### More words  
Let's have some big, fluffy clouds in this painting. Always keep the brush moving. It's the contrast in this painting that makes it so pretty. Let's get crazy here. Let them have a good time in your world. Always follow the angles. We are really trying to teach you a technique. We're not trying to teach you to copy. Just practice, and you really can do this. I'm a nature freak. Leave a little area open here. A lot of things happening right here. Throw in some happy little things wherever you want them. Let's really have some fun. Let 'em have it! Time to get crazy.

## FInal words  
Tongue got over my teeth there and I couldn't see what I was saying. If everything was good all the time, pretty soon you'd be accepting that as normal. Drop in a happy little sky here. If there's a secret to anything, it's practice. That's one of those happy accidents. It doesn't matter in our world where it goes. I think we'll put a happy little cloud up in the sky. ...three hairs and some air... Just let it sort of run across here, wherever you want it to go. Let's make some big, fluffy clouds today! Now things are going to start happening. I thought today, this would be our crazy painting. You can do anything you desire on this canvas. Be... so... careful! Devote a little time to working with it.
